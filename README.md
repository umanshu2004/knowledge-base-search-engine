# knowledge-base-search-engine
This project is a powerful search engine that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to answer questions based on a collection of documents you provide. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find the most relevant information in your documents and then uses that information to generate a concise, synthesized answer to your query.
